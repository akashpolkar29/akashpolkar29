# Hi there 👋  
I'm Akash Polkar, a Master's student in Mechatronics at RWU Hochschule Ravensburg-Weingarten, Germany 🇩🇪

Here's a quick snapshot about me:

🤖 Tech Explorer: Passionate about bridging mechanical systems with intelligent software through AI, Computer Vision, and Mechatronics.

📷 Computer Vision Enthusiast: Actively working on object detection, depth estimation, and image analysis using OpenCV and deep learning.

📊 Machine Learning Learner: Continuously building strong foundations in ML algorithms and applying them to real-world problems.

💡 Project Driven: I enjoy turning ideas into working solutions — from electric bike innovations to ArUco marker detection systems.

🚀 Eager to Collaborate: Open to connecting on innovative projects, research discussions, or just exchanging cool ideas around AI and embedded systems.

🌐 Let's connect!
